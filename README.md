# MachineLearningNotes
### Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### AI: 
A human inteligence exibited by machines. 

### Narrow AI:
An AI that is good only for one task, but very very well.

* Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
* Deep Learning:
  Also called deel neural netwark. It is a type of algorithm for machine learning.
  
  
### Machine learning Category:
1. Supervised Learning : Data with lables, regrassion
2. Unsupervised Learning: When groups don't exists. No labeling of the data, clustering
3. Reinforced Learning: Teaching machines by trial and error, Neural networks, decission trees, k-neares neighbors are the subfields.

## Machine Learning Framework Template:

1. **Problem definition:** Is it a supervise, or unsupervised, Classification or regrassion problem?
2. **Data:** Stractured (rows, columns), Unstructured (images, videos)
3. **Evaluation:** What defines success for us?
4. **Features:** What do we already know the data?
5. **Modeling:** Based on our problem and data, what model should work?
6. **Experimentation:** How can we improve or what can we do to improve?
