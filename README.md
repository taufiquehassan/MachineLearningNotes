# MachineLearningNotes
### Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### AI: 
A human inteligence exibited by machines. 

### Narrow AI:
An AI that is good only for one task, but very very well.

* Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
* Deep Learning:
  Also called deel neural netwark. It is a type of algorithm for machine learning.
  
  
### Machine learning Category:
1. Supervised Learning : Data with lables, regrassion
2. Unsupervised Learning: When groups don't exists. No labeling of the data, clustering
3. Reinforced Learning: Teaching machines by trial and error, Neural networks, decission trees, k-neares neighbors are the subfields.

## Machine Learning Framework Template:

1. **Problem definition:** Is it a supervise, or unsupervised, Classification or regrassion problem?
2. **Data:** Stractured (rows, columns), Unstructured (images, videos)
3. **Evaluation:** What defines success for us?
4. **Features:** What do we already know the data?
5. **Modeling:** Based on our problem and data, what model should work?
6. **Experimentation:** How can we improve or what can we do to improve?


### 1. Problem Definition:
#### Supervised Learning: #### 
* Classification and Regrassion
* Two kinds of Classification: Binary and multi-class classifications.

#### Supervised Learning: #### 
* No lables, but has pattern. Example: customer purchase history


#### Transfer Learning: #### 
* Find an existing model and then make soem more steps to adopt to the new problem


#### Reinforced Learning: #### 
* A good example is to teach an algorithm to play chase

### 2. Data:
* Structured Data:: Data are labled
* Unsctrutured Data: like an image or audio file
* Stati Data:
* Streaming Data:

### 3. Evaluation:
* Evaluation: How well a ML lgorithm predicts the future
* What defines the success
* How accurate the prediction should be
* Matrics: 
    * Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
    * Regrassion: mean abs error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square errot (RMSE)
    * Recommendation: Precision at K


### 4. Features:
* What do we already know about the data?
* How many features are there? 
* Numerical or categorical?

### 5. Modeling:
* There are three parts:
    * Choosing and training a model
    * Tuning a model
    * Model comparison

## Choosing and Training a Model:
# Choosing a Model:
* Structured data -> decission tree such as Random Forest, CatBoost etc
* Unstructured data -> Deep learning, Transfer Learning etc

#Training a Model:
* Line up inputs and outputs.
* Split the data.
* Might take some time.
